Open Closed Principle

Open ------> For extension
Closed ----> For modification

Add new functionality without changing the existing code.
which helps in making our application robust and extensible.

Don't use design patterns blindly anywhere, use only when its necessary.
Every pattern has a context.Use problem driven approach.

Don't use design pattern anywhere it will increase complexity. And it creates Design Smell in application or Over Engineering in a solution. ----> Not a good thing
